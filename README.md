# My Three.js Journey

In this repository I would like to collect my first 3D projects based on [Three.js](https://threejs.org/).

## Three.js Text

This 3D text visualization is based on the great [Three.js Journey](https://threejs-journey.com/) by Bruno Simon. I adjusted the code based on [this](https://threejs.org/examples/#webgl_geometry_text) example by [three.js](https://threejs.org/).

## Matcaps

The matcaps are from [https://github.com/nidorx/matcaps](https://github.com/nidorx/matcaps).
